# ðŸ“Š Analysis

- Analysis is largely the same as Level 1
- There will be more results to analyse because the scope and coverage of devices has grown.

The header of the analysis report should contain a confidence interval to explain how large of a sample set used is, compared to the total number of endpoint devices. This should clarify what the results represent compared to the total number of devices inside of a security zone.
