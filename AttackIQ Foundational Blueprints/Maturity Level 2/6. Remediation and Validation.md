# ðŸ©¹ Remediation and Validation

- Level 1 remediation and validation builds foundation to increase the scale for Level 2
- Level 1 vs Level 2 - more results and likely more failures to remediate
- This process will be tested in Level 1 and should be improved where necessary
- The validation process remains the same but more assessments will be required to be re-run
