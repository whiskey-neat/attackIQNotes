# ðŸ”® Reflection and Remediation

Level 2 is a continued opportunity to build and strengthen a foundation for a good process.

You should determine if your deployment of additional test point agents is working and whether you've prioritised and selected the right threat actors and security controls to assess.

You should also consider which key areas can be automated through schedulers within AttackIQ, within your own processes, automated scripts, or within the AttackIQ API.

A key list of questions can be found in the Level 2 Maturity questionnaire in the AttackIQ customer portal.  

At the end of Level 2, you should have:

- Demonstrated a complete end-to-end cycle of assessment, diagnosis, and remediation.
- The ability to retest with two agents in each security zone and be now ready to deploy additional agents, add more security testing criteria, and use the AttackIQ API to automate key tasks.
