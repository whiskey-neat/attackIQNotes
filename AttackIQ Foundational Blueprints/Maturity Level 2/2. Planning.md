# ðŸ“… Planning

When planning for Level 2 Maturity, plan which security and network zones contain additional attack surfaces and critical business assets.

In each identified zone, you should deploy at least two AttackIQ test point agents to assess and improve the current security controls

Level 2 Maturity is an opportunity to build a cadence and process around adding multiple assessments.

If you previously created a control-centric assessment, consider creating a threat-centric assessment.

If you previously created a threat-centric assessment, consider creating a control-centric assessment.

The focus point should always be the critical business assets and attack surface.

- Discuss what the threats are business critical assets
- Identify what primary and compensatory security controls are protecting these business critical assets
- Determine which scenarios are appropriate for assessments
- Determine how reporting should be formatted
- Consider if any additional AttackIQ integration manager plugins need to be activated
