#  Execution

In Level 1, exection is straightforward:

- Deploy two assets within a single security zone, with one assessment
- It is recommended to start with five scenarios (at most)
- Assign a person/team the role and responsibility of executing the assessment on cadence - daily, weekly, or bi-weekly

## Considerations

### Communication

You should coordinate communication across the organisation that an assessment is going to be run. Security operations and incident response teams should be notified if necessary.

The AttackIQ platform comes with a **pre-execution notification** feature. This will send out an email to specified recipients when an assessment runs. This helps people to differentiate between the AttackIQ assessment and a real attack.

### Scenario Misconfiguration

###### Incorrect Parameters
A scenario may fail if its parameters are set incorrectly e.g. running a Windows scenario on Mac OS X.

###### Permissions
A scenario may fail if ran in the context of a **super user** (System User, Root, Administrator etc) when it should have been run as a user with non-administrative privileges e.g. running a scenario as a Windows System user and trying to access the Windows user registry.
