# ðŸ§ª Selecting a Testing Approach

When assessing your security posture and readiness, you can take:

- a Control-Centric approach
- a Threat-Centric approach
- a hybrid of the two

Which approach you select will largely be based on the maturity of your program, the goal, and the team who is driving the practice.

**Threat-Centric Approach**
A threat-centric approach is recommended if your organisation has a threat intelligence team who has a solid grasp on the threat actors targeting the organisation and the TTP's being used

**Control-Centric Approach**
A control-centric approach is recommended if you don't have a threat intelligence team and you have a goal of assessing the capabilities of your security protection mechanisms

**Hybrid Approach**
A hybrid approach is used to test selected threat actors against specific controls.

## The Control-Centric Approach

Security technology should be assessed by policy and capabilities:

1. Identify a particular security technology control e.g. CrowdStrike Falcon
2. Divide the entire product or product suite into capabilities
3. Identify any unique policies you have turned on or off within the product or product suite
4. Build an assessment for a specific set of capabilities and policies
	1. Initially limit the number of scenarios used in an assessment until control efficacy is improved

AttackIQ recommends selecting and configuring scenarios using the following paths as options:

**1. Consult internal control-centric SME (subject matter expert)**

A SME can:
- be consulted and prepare scenarios for assessment
- use their knowledge to understand
	- specific capabilities and policies of your security technologies
	- particular details of a threat actor group
- make assessments that are more intentional

**2. Consult your security vendors**

The SME is likely to have a good relationship with the relevant security vendors. The SME should be able to reach out to the relevant security vendors to:
- Maximise the way security technologies are configured
- Ask for guidance on the best TTPs to use
- When/If failures occur, how to remediate those failures within the specified security technology

**3. Rely on AttackIQ assessment templates**

- Are good for getting started
- Are pre-built and pre-configured
- Can/Should be customised to align with your specific goals

## The Threat-Centric Approach

Security defences should be assessed by threat actor TTP groupings (as opposed to every TTP all at once):

1. Identify a particular threat actor group to assess
2. Divide the behaviour of the threat actor by TTPs and map them to the attacker kill chain
3. Build an assessment per threat actor group

AttackIQ recommends selecting and configuring scenarios using the following paths as options:

**1. Consult internal threat-centric SME (subject matter expert)**

Your SME or threat intelligence team can utilise the MITRE AT&CK framework, threat intelligence feeds, and internal knowledge to understand the specific capabilities and policies of your security technology and/or details of a threat actor group.

**2. Leverage the MITRE ATT&CK framework**

Scenarios can be selected for a security technology or threat group by mapping the associated TTPs to the relevant ATT&CK matrix. 

- Level 1 Maturity: Add 5 related scenarios and build an assessment.
- Scenarios should be selected based on security technology policy or related TTPs

**3. Consult your industry ISAC (Infomation Sharing and Analysis Centre)**

A ISAC group is a non-profit organisation that provides central resources for gathering information on cyberthreats to critical infrastructure and for sharing information between the public and private sector.
