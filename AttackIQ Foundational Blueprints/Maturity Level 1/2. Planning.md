# ðŸ“… Level 1 Maturity - Planning

The planning stage consists of:

- Scoping work
- Assigning responsibilities
- Identifying scenarios

Planning in Level 1 Maturity builds a foundation and demonstrates a repeatable process.

It establishes an end-to-end, continuous cycle of assessing a security technology and emulating a threat actor.

Planning will also help a team to diagnose and resolve misconfigurations and issues that are found to improve and optimise your overall security program.

The continuous Security Optimisation Lifecycle measures how long it takes to assess, diagnose, and remediate. This process should always be improved so should be assessed on a monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly basis to begin with.
