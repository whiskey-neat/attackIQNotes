# Basic Demonstration - Level 1 Maturity

Level 1 is about understanding who is involved, what are their tasks, and in what capacity are they acting (RACI)?

The goal of Level 1 Maturity is to:

- Assign key roles and responsibilities
- Deploy two test point agents in one security goal
- Create one assessment focused on either one security technology or one threat actor group using no more than five scenarios
- Demonstrate the end-to-end Security Optimisation Lifecycle

A limited number of scenarios and test points should be used because this allows for a solid and manageable process.

When you are able to demonstrate improvement using a single security technology or threat actor group, then you are in a position to expand to include other security technologies and further test criteria across additional test point agents.
