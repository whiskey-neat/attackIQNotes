# ðŸ““ Reporting on Implementation

You should also write a report on the implementation of your AttackIQ practice.

- Measure and report on how long the initial planning process took
- Who was involved?
- What did you discuss and what was the outcome?

Then, upon each iteration of running assessments, capture how long it takes to plan, execute, analsye, remediate, validate, reflect and automate.

You should be able to demonstrate an ability to improve your own security optimisation lifecycle.
