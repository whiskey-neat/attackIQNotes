# ðŸ”® Reflection and Automation

Your team should reflect upon your assessment, coordination, and process.

You should be discussing ways to improve.

Questions to consider:

- How long did each stage take and how can you optimise key areas of each stage?
- Are there scenarios that should be added, modified, or removed?
- Are the locations of AttackIQ test point agents accurately reflecting critical business assets?

Insights should be shared with management and stakeholders about the continued improvement and efficacy of protective security controls for critical business assets.
