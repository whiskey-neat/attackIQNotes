## Control Efficacy Reporting

Some scenarios will be used to show that specific security controls cannot be remediated easily and may require your team to accept the associated risk.

For these scenarios, keep in mind that failure will persist and the user has the option to remove the scenario from the testing criteria.

It's extremely valuable to demonstrate historical efficacy of a particular security control over time and how itâ€™s improved due to optimization from testing and retesting.

Also keep in mind that any security technology can at any point fail on scenarios due to misconfigurations or environment changes.
