# Level 1 Maturity - Summary

# Goal of Level 1 Maturity

The goal of level 1 maturity is to:

- Assign key roles and responsibilities
- Deploy two test point agents in one security goal
- Create one assessment focused on either one security technology or one threat actor- using no more than five scenarios
- Demonstrate the end-to-end Security Optimisation Lifecycle

# Planning

The planning stage consists of:

- Scoping work
- Assigning responsibilities
- Identifying scenarios

# Tasks, Roles and Responsibilities

The tasks, roles and responsibilities should be clearly documented and assigned. A chart can be useful for tracking the required tasks, who is assigned to them, and in what capacity (using the RACI model)

# Selecting a Testing Approach

When assessing your security posture, you can take:

- A control-centric approach
	- no threat intel team
	- goal of assessing the capabilities of security controls
- A threat-centric approach
	- access to a threat intel team
	- thorough knowledge of likely threat actors and TTPs
- A hybrid of the two

## Control-Centric Approach

Assess security technology by policy and capabilities with these steps:

1. Identify a particular security technology control e.g. CrowdStrike Falcon
2. Divide the entire product or product suite into capabilities
3. Identify any unique policies you have turned on/off within the product or product suite
4. Build an assessment for a specific set of capabilities and policies (initially limit the number of scenarios used in an assessment until control efficacy is improved)
	Select and configure scenarios:
	- Consult internal control-centric SME
	- Consult your security vendors
	- Rely on AttackIQ assessment templates
