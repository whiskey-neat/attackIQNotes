# üìÑ Assessment Creation and Scenario Configuration

Running successful scenarios **requires** a defined goal and clear plan. Scenarios should be selected intentionally and in small chunks.

## Scenarios and AttackIQ Platform

Scenarios in the AttackIQ platform are flexible.

You can use preconfigured scenarios or entire assessments made up of multiple scenarios or you can choose to configure your own scenario with custom parameters.

Users can even develop their own scenarios using Python! üêç

When configuring scenarios it is important to understand how parameters work and which user the scenario is run as because these factors will affect the scenario results.

When taking a control-centric approach to testing, be as specific as possible.

Example: Assessing the efficacy of an EDR product

Instead of building an assessment or set of scenarios to assess all features of the EDR, it's recommended to assess a particular policy or set of capabilities.
