# ðŸ“Š Analysis

In the analysis stage, you collect and analyse results.

If the AttackIQ integration manager has been set up with log aggregation, or the SIEM plugin, the platform automatically attempts to correlate results.

A scenario can have the following results:

- `Prevented | Not Prevented` (attack-type scenario)
- `Detected | Not Detected` (attack-type scenario)
- `Validated | Not Validated` (validation-type scenario)

If the AttackIQ integration manager has not been set up then:

- Scenarios `Prevented | Not Prevented` can still be automatically determined
- Scenarios `Detected | Not Detected` will require manual hunting through logs
