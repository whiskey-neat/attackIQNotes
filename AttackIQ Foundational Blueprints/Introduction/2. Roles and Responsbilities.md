# Roles and Responsibilities

The team member leading the implementation of threat-informed defence should identify the roles and responsibilities early in the implementation process.

RACI is a model to help determine the roles throughout the process:

Who is:
- R: Responsible
- A: Accountable
- C: Consulted
- I: Informed

Team members and stakeholders need to know what is expected of them so that it is easier for them to complete their work and for the overall project to be successful. AttackIQ customers can find example uses of "RACI for Automated Testing" in the customer portal.

In planning and assigning roles and responsibilities, stakeholders should be kept regularly informed and allowed the opportunity to ask about the new program and practices.

Example key stakeholders to consider:

- **IT** - to discuss change management and/or deployment architecture
- **Security Architecture** - to provide with a clear understanding of how the AttackIQ architecture works
- **Incident Response** - to include on remediation strategies and implementation

Assigning roles and responsibilities makes the journey through different levels of maturity much easier and successful.
