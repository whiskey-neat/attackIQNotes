# ðŸŽ¯ Defining Goals

Defining goals and creating a plan enables focus and and maximises the opportunity for success. Security optimisation goals work best when based around defined critical business assets and an assumed attack surface.

## Business Critical Assets

Defining business critical assets and/or attack surface is the first step towards mapping those assets to business processes and perceived threats - creating the criteria for assessing the security controls believed to be in place.

## Business Risk

Demonstrating how a particular business asset is effectively protected aligns goals to business risk.

This is the first step towards creating a threat-informed defence. Creating a plan in context to a specific, measurable goal with prioritisation to business processes and a clear understanding of assets, controls in place, and the expected behaviour of those controls, users can prove the efficacy of protection controls surrounding core critical business assets.

## Documentation

Once a goal is defined, it should be documented and stated in any reporting that is communicated. Without goals, it is hard to get support from peers, stakeholders, and leadership. It is therefore important to promote the goal (as well as expected business outcomes) with the various stakeholders. This will help your entire organisation understand the value and reasoning being deploying AttackIQ to test point agents.
